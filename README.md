## The SimpleDE Algorithm

The SimpleDE algorithm has been developed by Stan Wagon for solving many-modal optimization problems in low dimensions with high accuracy. There is a reference implementation in Mathematica code in chapter 4 of the book "The SIAM 100-Digit Challenge", see the references below. There is also an R implementation in the {adagio} package on CRAN.

The main goal of this repository is to provide implementations in different programming languages, solving some example optimization test functions, and compare running times (also with the original code in Mathematica).

Programming languages:

* R
* Julia
* Fortran (i.e., modern Fortran)
* MATLAB / Octave
* Python
* Lua / LuaJIT
* Nim / C
