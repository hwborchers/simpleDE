## The SimpleDE Algorithm

The SimpleDE algorithm has been developed by Stan Wagon for solving many-modal optimization problems in low dimensions with high accuracy. There is a reference implementation in Mathematica code in chapter 4 of the book "The SIAM 100-Digit Challenge", see the references below. There is also an R implementation in the {adagio} package on CRAN.
